            <p>well... where do i start?</p>

              hey!! my name is francis, all my friends call me frankie, you can
              call me such too. like everyone i've had a pretty interesting
              life. i've been to a lot of places and i've met a lot of people.
              i've been through a lot of things, and i've learned plenty of
              others. i've had a lot of highs, and i've had a lot of lows. but
              nonetheless, i am always grateful for every moment, for each one
              has shaped me into who i am today. if not for every single moment,
              from most miniscule to the most grand, i wouldn't be right where i
              am.
            </p>
            <p>
              you've entered the personal section of my portfolio, and so i've
              decided to treat it a little bit like a journal -i do journal by
              the way (daily)- and i also like to read plenty, mostly philosophy
              and non-fiction literature, maybe one day i'll get into fiction.
              who knows?
            </p>
            <p>
              i do hope that you were pleased to find that your venture to this
              section has led you not to a list of my hobbies, or my favorite
              movies, or my favorite foods, or my favorite color, or my favorite
              anything. i figured i showed a little bit of my inner monologue
              instead, you can find out the other details yourself. if intrigued
              anyways, please do go ahead and contact me so we can have a chat.
              i hope you enjoy your stay :)
