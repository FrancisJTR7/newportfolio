              hey!! my name is francis, all my friends call me frankie, you can
              call me such too. like everyone i've had a pretty interesting
              life. i've been to a lot of places and i've met a lot of people.
              i've been through a lot of things, and i've learned plenty of
              others. i've had a lot of fun, and i've had a lot of pain. but
              nonetheless, i am always grateful for every moment that has shaped
              me into who i am today. if not for every single moment, from most
              miniscule to the most grand, i wouldn't be right where i am.
            </p>

              you've entered the personal section of my portfolio, and so i've
              decided to treat it a little bit like a journal -i do journal by
              the way, daily- and i also like to read plenty, mostly philosophy
              and non-fiction literature, but maybe one day i'll get into
              fiction. who knows?
            </p>

              you may be displeased (or maybe not?) to find that your venture to
              this section has led you not to a list of my hobbies, or my
              favorite movies, or my favorite foods, or my favorite color, or my
              favorite anything. i figured i showed a little bit of my inner
              monologue more instead, you can find out the little details
              yourself. if intrigued, please do go ahead and contact me so we
              can have a chat. i hope you enjoy your stay :)
